# Mechanitor Command Relays

Adds command relays which project a radius of control for a tuned mechanitor around them. These relays are unlocked via Standard Mechtech research, and cost one Standard Subcore to construct.

This mod depends on Andreas Pardeike's [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) library.
